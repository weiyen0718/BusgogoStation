###Description ( Hsinzhu Bus Website )

We use *Hsinzhu Bus Website* because we often take hsinzhu bus to somewhere.
Everytime we are heading for somewhere, we go to their website(http://www.hcbus.com.tw/) to get information about their service station, time, and route.
Therefore, we think it will be convenience for us to use web scraper to get specific information we want.

By the way, this website dosen't provide API and need not log in.
